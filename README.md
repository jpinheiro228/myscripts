# myscripts

My configuration files for Emacs (Spacemacs), ZSH and a few usefull scrips.

To enable ZSH configuration, make a link on your home folder:

```bash
    cd ~
    ln -s git-repos/myscripts/zshrc .zshrc
```

To enable Spacemacs configuration, make a link on your home folder:

```bash
    cd ~
    ln -s git-repos/myscripts/spacemacs .spacemacs
```
